How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring code, program, software is functional can be a time consuiming task . Testing can be done from the test classes in your project. Over and over gain again until there is no error from the debugging process. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To interpet user needs into a program, first you must read their requirements. Making sure you understannd what they are asking for is the first step. Then I read that and incorporated that into the program by using an if statement which covered both of the failure options. This is a basic way of translating a need into a program because it takes the need directly into a conditional for success. There are more ambiguous requirements sometimes that take some deeper looking. One program I had in another class required the program to be able to, on the push of a button, add time to two separate clocks. That was broken down very extensively into a program but not in this same manner because you had the general requirement but it wasn't something as simple as creating an illegal argument exception.


How do I approach designing software?
I tend to take a look at the requirements documents or interview transcripts if that method is chosen, and create a checklist of requirements. These requirements I then, if applicable, break into a list of objects needed to accomplish this and then do the same for the methods needed.
